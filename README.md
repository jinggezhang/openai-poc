Introduction
ocal governments in British Columbia affect all citizens on a day-to-day basis. This book
describes how those governments operate in the province. The perspective taken in the book is
that local governments are a set of institutions that facilitate the ability of citizens to resolve
problems and provide local goods and services in more responsive and efficient ways than a provincial
government could. At the same time, however, it is the provincial government that legislates and regulates
these institutional arrangements. Within this context it is useful to briefly consider the role of local
governments.
1.1 The Role of Local Government
Many political scientists and political philosophers have emphasized the role of local government as a
training ground for democracy, enabling local citizens to participate in collective endeavours and thus to
learn how to temper individual ambitions with concern for others. Most desired from this process is the
achievement of a sense of community among members. Some scholars in this tradition are advocates of
town-meeting or neighbourhood-sized governments to facilitate popular participation. Even those who
question the efficiency of such small governments agree that participation and community are themselves
appropriate goals.
A quite different perspective is provided by scholars from engineering, economics, and public administration, who see the role of local government as a provider of goods and services such as streets,
schools, policing, water supply, and sewage disposal. Many analysts with this viewpoint have neglected
the ideals of citizen participation and have focused instead on economies of scale in production and the
interdependencies of production relationships. These analysts have often recommended relatively large
governments that cover, for instance, entire metropolitan areas. In their concern for structuring government according to economies of scale, some go so far as to see no significant distinction between
decentralized central administration and local self-government.
The perspective taken in this volume is that neither participation nor production efficiency criteria
alone provide an adequate basis for evaluating local government structure. Local government is not a
game in which many should be taxed so others can participate. Communities of people face important
collective problems and participation to resolve those problems is a much more meaningful experience
than participation as an end in itself. Participation has a specific purpose—to resolve common problems,
provide desired services and facilitate control over one’s environment in cooperation with others. For
those who value a sense of community, such feelings may be a part of the experience, but it would be
unrealistic to expect these subjective benefits to be universal. Some may regard a strong sense of
community to be an impediment to individual initiative. The developer, for instance, whose rezoning
proposal is reviewed at a public hearing may see his participation as a necessary evil—a time-consuming
and costly delay, rather than a process that has intrinsic value in and of itself.

Politics and policy
Political decision making at the local level involves more direct participation than provincial or national
policymaking. The effects of local government decisions are often immediate and tangible. For example,
a decision to build a new park, pave a road, or construct a recreation centre results in a recognizable social
benefit, the cost of which is reflected in annual property tax bills.
A great variety of decisions are involved in local government operations. A citizen may decide to
stand as a candidate for office, vote for the candidate of his or her choice, or select an option in a
referendum. Elected officials decide how to vote on council, and administrators make decisions on service
production and delivery. Even at the administrative level, citizen participation is common. The resident
who reports a crime or a fire, or complains that a stop sign is missing from an intersection, is a participant
in the administration of his or her community. Citizens also form voluntary organizations, such as
neighbourhood associations and community clubs, to undertake quasi-governmental functions and
become directly involved in decision making. The resulting environment within which citizens and local
governments interact is very complex.
A dual role
Local governments in B.C. are mechanisms through which local residents can undertake preferred
collective activities. They are also administrative extensions of the provincial government. This dual role
is often a source of conflict between local and provincial officials because each tends to regard its role as
the most important. To complicate matters, various provincial agencies may take divergent approaches to
disagreements that occur. As local governments operate under provincial legislation, the provincial
government can always resolve disputes by changing laws to put itself in a superior legal position but
many, if not most, conflicts appear to be resolved by mutual accommodation rather than provincial fiat.
1.2 Basic Concepts and Objectives
All citizens must make choices on how to obtain resources and use those resources. Obtaining resources
requires knowledge, effort and all the decisions those activities entail. Using resources requires making
choices as to what to purchase. Citizens try to make these choices so they are better off. There is no
reason to expect different behaviour when it comes to resolving problems, obtaining local services, and
paying for them. All of these activities can be accomplished in different ways, and some ways are likely
to achieve better results for citizens than others.
Values
For the purposes of the analyses in this book, a basic value judgement is that institutions of government
should be designed so people can resolve problems and provide local goods and services collectively,
in a manner that achieves the greatest net benefit. This approach is the same as trying to design
institutions that achieve economic efficiency, because economic efficiency, in contrast to technical or
engineering efficiency, depends on comparing the value of the resources that are used with the value of
the outputs and outcomes. The concept of economic efficiency must include citizens’ values, and to
weigh these values, citizens must have mechanisms to voice their preferences and play a role in balancing
the costs and benefits of local government decisions. Democratic participation is a necessary component
of economic efficiency.
When we move from private markets to collective decision making we encounter several additional
difficulties. For example, the preferences of individuals vary. Some would like more parks, others more
policing and others, lower taxes. In addition, the same geographical boundaries and the same kind of
decision-making process will not work for all of the activities in which local governments are engaged. It
is the attempt to create a local government system that can provide opportunities for citizens with
different preferences to deal with different kinds of goods and services over different geographical
boundaries that leads to the establishment of many different kinds of local governments and many
relationships among them. It is this polycentric, multigovernmental organizational system that this book is
designed to help understand.
Evaluative criteria
Multiple criteria are used to evaluate a governmental system and individual governments. The most
important criterion is the extent to which decision makers, who are usually elected officials, have to
balance the benefits to their constituents against the costs that will be imposed on those constituents
with taxes, service charges and/or the costs of complying with regulations. There is no way provincial
ministry officials can monitor and evaluate the decisions of local government officials, and even in a
participatory system with elections, referenda, meetings, and hearings, citizens cannot be involved in all
of the decisions. Thus when examining the properties of a system, the criterion that decision makers
balance benefits and costs, called fiscal equivalence, is an important one. This criterion informs the
discussions throughout this book, especially the financing alternatives examined in Chapter 12.
It is also useful to have criteria to evaluate performance for the production of an individual service,
program, or capital investment. Because of the diverse activities of local governments, there is no single
way to do these kinds of evaluation. In Chapter 6 we will examine a range of approaches that includes
measures of technical, engineering and operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, other performance
measures, program evaluations, and cost-benefit analysis.
1.3 Collective Problems
Because the environment in which citizens and local governments interact is a very complex one, it is
useful to examine the kinds of problems people use government to resolve and some of the concepts
associated with these problems.
Public goods and free-riders
Public goods, as defined by economists, are goods or services that are available for everyone to use and
for which, until crowding occurs, one person’s use does not interfere with another’s. For example, when
streets, sidewalks, or dikes are constructed, or eradication of a contagious disease is accomplished,
everyone may benefit and no one is excluded. The fact that the exclusion of benefits for some people is
not generally feasible means that direct charges or voluntary contributions cannot be used for finance.
With public goods there is no way to exclude “free-riders”—people who refuse to pay—from using or
benefiting. If too many abuse the system, insufficient contributions may mean the good or service cannot
be supported. The solution is to have a government, which has the coercive capacity to tax, to maintain
the provision of public goods that are mutually beneficial. An important dimension of public goods is
maintaining a desirable total environment, to which most land use regulation is devoted.
External effects
External effects are the effects of one’s activities on non-involved parties. Pollution, for example, is a
classic case. Disposal of wastes by a person or business may negatively affect others. Negative external
effects may be dealt with under common law but, rather than rely on court suits by damaged parties, it has
become common for government to regulate such effects. Public health rules are some of the earliest
regulations to deal with potentially negative consequences. Fire codes and anti-noise bylaws are other
examples.
Common pools
A special kind of external effect occurs with common-pool resources. A common pool is a natural
resource that is available for communal use but, if too many use it, the resource itself may be destroyed.
Thus some kind of regulation may be required for resource preservation. A classic common pool is
groundwater. Overpumping may destroy it. Government authority may be necessary to prevent “freeriders” from abusing the system. In British Columbia, common-pool resources are generally regulated by
the province rather than by local governments, but local governments often draw on common-pool
resources for water supply and sometimes for liquid waste disposal.
Utilities
The provision of utilities, such as water supply and sewerage, is often undertaken by local government.
Utilities do not possess the characteristics of public goods because it is easy to exclude users who do not
pay. Their status as natural monopolies and the need for easements along transmission routes has led to
price regulation, expropriation authority and public provision in most municipalities.
Business regulation
Businesses are often regulated to help consumers make an informed purchase. Proper labelling of
products and the inspection of scales and taxi meters are examples of regulations that prevent cheating
and protect consumers. Most businesspeople favour controls because they eliminate competition from
people who cut corners to obtain business. Business regulation may also prevent legitimate competition,
allowing existing businesses to charge higher prices.
Welfare
Not everyone can be expected to, or is able to, participate in labour markets to earn an income adequate
for a reasonable standard of living. At one time local governments played a major role in supporting
needy residents but as societies have become more mobile, the responsibility for income redistribution
and social programs has shifted to senior government. In British Columbia these activities are managed
primarily by the provincial government but local governments can be directly affected by concentrations
of welfare recipients and are involved in housing and other social support programs.
